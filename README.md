# TheTitanicDisaster
As apart of the Machine Learning Course at Afeka College, we had a task to participate on the ML Kaggle Competition: Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster.
I`ve explored the data, removed and created new features, used cross-validation methods for optimizing hyper-parameters, and used the sklearn ML models for the Titanic Survivors classification .
